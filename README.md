Primary tables vs. report tables

Primary tables contain the most up-to-date information.
New data uploaded using Wrangler goes directly into the primary tables after validation.
New reports are generated when new data comes in, but old reports are never deleted.
Primary tables contain patient identifiable information while report tables do not.
